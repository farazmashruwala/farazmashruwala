Stable Diffusion Intro

A man with eyes wide open, surprised, in awe,  Stable Diffusion is an open-source text-to-image
                           digital art         AI model that can generate amazing images from
                                               given texts in seconds.

                                               The model was trained on images in the LAION-5B dataset. It
                                               was developed by CompVis, Stability AI and RunwayML. All

Prompt Engineering

                    Intro

                    Prompt engineering is the process of structuring
                    words that can be interpreted and understood by a
                    text-to-image model. Think of it as the language you
                    need to speak in order to tell an AI model what to
                    draw.

                    Prompt engineering is a great way to stretch the limitations of
                    Text2IM models. Good prompts can make images go from good to
                    great.

Prompt Engineering

  This prompt book will help you learn essential building blocks and
  all the techniques to master Stable Diffusion.
  The secret for generating good images

      A well-written prompt consisting of modifiers and a good
            sentence structure. We will introduce the prompt format in the
            section 2. We will also show you all types of modifiers you can
            use in the section 3 and some magic words in the section 4.

      Well-adjusted Stable Diffusion parameters. (section 5). You can
            always use the default, but sometimes fine-tuned parameters
            can generate better results. This will strengthen your ability to
            bring your creative dream images to life.

a suit, natural light, in the sky, with bright
colors, by Studio Ghibli



However, there is a problem. The goldendoodle is
NOT in the sky... The AI didn't take in "in the sky"
properly.
Worry not! You can change the order of the words a
little bit if one part is important. The earlier a word is
in the sentence, the more importance it will be given.

The order of words is important

The order and presentation of our desired output is almost as an important aspect as the vocabulary itself. It
is recommended to list your concepts explicitly and separately than trying to cramp it into one simple
sentence.

Portrait Artists

Using an artist that is known for doing portraits can be very helpful in creating a specific style. In all the
images below everything was kept the same including the seed, All the differences are caused by the artist

chosen. As you can see some artists have a very profound effect and others have just a subtle effect.

Landscape Artists

When making a landscape it's smart to give a set of day like morning, noon or night time and to set the
season. Notice that some artists only influence the output subtly while others change it drastically

When it comes to creating a character you want to first describe the broad description of them like "male orc"
then adding more to them like "metallic armor". After that building the details while generating the images
and make sure to add artists fitting the person

Resolution ­ default is 512x512

This parameter is straight forward. You choose the Width and Height of the generated images. But it's
important to know that the model was trained on 512x512 images, and in general these dimensions provide
the best quality and composition, so it is recommended you stick to them as a beginner.

You can see this parameter as a "Creativity vs. Prompt" scale. Lower numbers give the AI more freedom to be
creative, while higher numbers force it to stick to the prompt.

Step count ­ default is 50

Stable Diffusion creates an image by starting with a canvas full of noise and denoise it gradually to reach the
final output, this parameter controls the number of these denoising steps. Usually, higher is better but to a
certain degree, for beginners it's recommended to stick with the default.

Steps: 1             Steps: 2             Steps: 3             Steps: 4             Steps: 5

          Steps: 40            Steps: 30            Steps: 20            Steps: 10

This parameter does not affect the VRAM needed, but increasing it is directly proportional to the time it takes to generate an image

Seed ­ default is "random"

Seed is a number that controls the initial noise. The seed is the reason that you get a different image each
time you generate when all the parameters are fixed. By default, on most implementations of Stable
Diffusion, the seed automatically changes every time you generate an image. You can get the same result
back if you keep the prompt, the seed and all other parameters the same.

Sampler

Diffusion samplers are the method used to denoise the image during generation, and since they differ in the
way of calculating the next step in the image production, they take different durations and different number
of steps to reach a usable image. We suggest beginners to use DDIM since it's fast and can usually generate
good images with only 10 steps, making it easy and fast to experiment and improve

The power of seeds

Some seed are just better for a prompt, so try to save a good seed and slightly tweak the prompt to get what
you're looking for while keeping the same composition. This can also be used to test the effect of different
modifiers.

All these images used the same seed and parameters,  Painting of a cute cat
only change was the prompt                           holding an umbrella

Token efficiency

Your prompt is limited effectively to 75 tokens. If you are working with a long prompt try to be efficient with
words that do not significantly add to your meaning. A typical example is when using an artist as a modifier
to get a particular style. Here are a few prompts and their token counts. They all will produce a piece that
looks like it was created by Vincent Van Gogh with their associated token counts,

    A horse in the style of Vincent Van Gogh (11)
    A horse in the style of Van Gogh (10)
    A horse by Vincent Van Gogh (7)
    A horse by Van Gogh (6)
    Horse by Van Gogh (6)
    Horse Van Gogh (5)

All will accomplish the result but are not exactly the same.                                                                                                                                      78

You can use the negative prompt to tell Stable Diffusion what not to include in the image. This is especially
useful when paired with using the same seed for the new generation!

Img2Img Variation

Img2Img is useful for creating a variation of a image and getting similar images

                           If you wish to create a image but something isn't quite
                               right you can use Img2Img to remake the image

                            With This you can see that it changed the
                           layout and the time of day but kept the idea

Img2Img Variations Low Strength

Img2Img is useful for creating a variation of a image and getting similar images

                                   At times the image at the start will be correct but
                                  not the face you want so if you use Img2Img with a
                                  low strength you can recreate the image until you

                                                          get a face you like.

                                   With This you can see that it changed the face to
                                   Gordon. The issue is that this image was the most

                                       creative but it failed to give it the right face.
